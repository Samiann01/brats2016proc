\section{Experiments \& Results}
\label{sec: results}

\subsection{Experimental setting}

The proposed approach is implemented within the DF framework described in~\cite{zikic2012decision}. All experiments were performed on a 
3.6GHz Intel Xeon processor system with 16GB RAM running Microsoft Windows 10.
Windowing details, etc.

%\subsection{Hold-out estimates, auto-context, guided bagging: an analysis}
%This is what we have been doing throughout the paper. Singling out individual contributions.

\subsection{BRATS benchmark: Multi-modal MR brain tumor segmentation}

Report running times! Compare to the literature! Try to do the BRATS 2013 leaderboard comparison (array of numbers). BRATS 2015 accuracy vs. number of training images, with varying train/test subsets. Compare to AutoGlioS baseline + to 1-layer CVE forests. Report predicted accuracy (training).

\subsection{Multi-organ segmentation from CT scans}
